# onBoardingDemo

This project is a simple react native project.
You can find an example of the OnBoarding Slider structure I made here by looking at this repository.
If you want to use such a structure in your own projects, this repository will help you. 

After cloning the project, you can use the repository to install the packages:

## Run this command:

```

npm install 
 
```
